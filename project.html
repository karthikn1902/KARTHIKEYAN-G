                    <p> The task of managing a library is not easy. Librarians look after thousands of books and manage the catalog. They also ensure that the needs of all readers are met on time. They work with different stakeholders-students, academicians, and other library staff to ensure everyone gets what they need. To manage the library smoothly, librarians also need to have specific skills. For example, they must know the art of managing and working in a team. With various responsibilities in hand, the task of managing a library becomes even more challenging. However, the workload can be decreased by using an effective library management system. With the help of software for library management, librarians can improve their efficiency and cater to different stakeholders hassle-free. Before understanding the applicability of this software, let us know the key responsibilities of a library manager</p>
            <B><u><td>RESPONSIBILITIES OF LIBRARY:</td></u></B><br>
                <LI>Ordering books, journals, and other learning materials</LI>
            <LI>Recording and keeping track of library resources
                <LI>Advising educators about the books they can use for their courses</LI>
                <LI> Ensuring every learner or reader gets access to the required resources on time</LI>
                    <LI>Working on the requests from students, staff, and other library users</LI>
                        <LI>Managing library resources</LI>
                            <LI>Making and managing library budget</LI>
                                <LI>Promoting library resources</LI>
                                    <p>Managing all these tasks single-handedly can be tiring and may make the job monotonous. Therefore, librarians are suggested to use automation to make the processes more efficient. By using a library management system, library managers can make the job easier for them and the book lovers around them.</p>
                
                <P>Implementing a library management system means digitizing the work for all stakeholders. Here are a few features that an efficient library management system must have.</P>
